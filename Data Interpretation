Data Interpretation
Interpretation and Reporting: Finally, interpret the customer segments from a marketing perspective. Understand what each cluster signifies and how it could be targeted with specific marketing strategies. Additionally, conduct an analysis of the acquisition channels and their overall performance.
Think about the channels through which customers visited the platform and their regions. Go through the different segments and analyze the different groups of customers. Ask such questions as:

Are there segments that bring in engaged students with high CLV?
From which channels do they originate, and from which regions do they come?
Through those observations, you can ultimately devise a strategy for the following:

New customer acquisition: Through which channels should each region be approached? If we observe that most US citizens come from LinkedIn, or Google, then this indicates that these channels perform well for that country, and we ought to authorize more ad spend in these two channels for the US.
Channels Performance Analysis: Are there channels underperforming? For example, suppose you see only a few clients from a particular channel, say Instagram, or have a certain number of clients with low engagement scores and CLVs. In that case, itâ€™s clear that this channel is not attracting enough or the right kind of consumers for the product. Suggest a strategy to improve channel acquisition or an alternative step to reduce costs associated with the channel.
Note: For this interpretation, assume that the current marketing spend allocates equal amounts to each channel for acquisition and allocates matching funds to the three regions of countries, the Anglo-Saxon, Europe, and the rest of the world.
