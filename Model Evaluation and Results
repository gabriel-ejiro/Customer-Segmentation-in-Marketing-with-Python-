Model Evaluation and Results
In this part of the project, you must analyse the results of the segmentation you've already performed. Follow these three steps:

Use the hierarchical clustering results to select the optimal number of clusters and run a k-means algorithm with the determined number.
Create a summary table for each cluster and its characteristics and add several observations and the proportion of observations column for each.
Come up with names and explanations for each cluster. 
You can rely on the characteristics of the data. We have information about the studentsâ€™ engagement level, CLV, country region, and the acquisition channel. So, for example, you might have a cluster of highly engaged Eastern European customers who have heard about us via YouTube or Google. You might label this segment European YouTube Google Mix.

Similarly, you should find characteristics and labels for the remainder of the segments.
